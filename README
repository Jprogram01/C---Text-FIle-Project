I wrote a program that reads text from a file, organizes the data into a list the goes from highest word usage count to lowest word usage count

The purpose for this program is that I wanted to better familiarize myself with the language of C++, and also get more familiar with working with files in a coding situation.

# Development Environment


I used VS code and text files to develop this software.

I used C++ and built in functions for this program.
