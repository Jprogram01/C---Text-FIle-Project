# Overview

I wrote a program that reads text from a file, organizes the data into a list the goes from highest word usage count to lowest word usage count

The purpose for this program is that I wanted to better familiarize myself with the language of C++, and also get more familiar with working with files in a coding situation.

# Development Environment

I used VS code and text files to develop this software.

I used C++ and built in functions for this program.

# Future Work

- Sort words by word type (noun, verb, adjective)
- Add web scraping so the program function can be used for webpages
- Add user input for text files so the it is dynamic.
